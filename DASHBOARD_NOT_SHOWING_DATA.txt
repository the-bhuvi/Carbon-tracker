## Why Did This Happen?

The dashboard displays data from "summary" tables in the database. Think of it like this:

```
Your Data (monthly_audit_data)
    ↓
    ↓ (needs refresh to calculate)
    ↓
Summary Tables (monthly_summary, academic_year_summary)
    ↓
    ↓ (dashboard reads from these)
    ↓
Dashboard Display
```

When you use the **Admin Input form**, this refresh happens automatically. When you add data directly to the database, it doesn't. That's why you don't see it.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will I need to do this every time?**
A: Only if you add data directly to the database. If you use the Admin Input form, it's automatic.

**Q: The page says "Refresh Current Year" - should I use that?**
A: Only if you added data for multiple months. For single months, use "Refresh Current Month".

**Q: I clicked refresh but still don't see data?**
A: Make sure to:
1. Check that the Dashboard year/month matches your data
2. Refresh your browser page (press Ctrl+R)
3. Make sure you're looking at the right view (Monthly vs Academic Year)

**Q: Can I add data directly to the database?**
A: Yes, but then you need to refresh. It's easier to use the Admin Input form.

**Q: The /refresh-dashboard page won't load?**
A: Make sure you're logged in as an admin, not as a student.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Try this checklist:

- [ ] Did the refresh show a green "Success" message?
- [ ] Did you go back to the dashboard?
- [ ] Did you refresh the page (Ctrl+R)?
- [ ] Are you looking at the right month/year?
- [ ] Is your data actually in the system? (Check with your database admin)
- [ ] Are you logged in as an admin?

If all of these check out and it still doesn't work, contact your system admin.

## Remember for Next Time

✅ **USE THIS:** The Admin Input form (`/admin/input`)
- It's the regular way to enter data
- Automatic refresh
- No extra steps

❌ **AVOID THIS:** Adding data directly to the database
- Requires manual refresh afterward
- Easy to forget
